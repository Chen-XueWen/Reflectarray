You will need matlab to open the mlapp file. It contains the source code for the reflectarray designer software.

The Components folder contains all my unwrapped code (which might not be the most updated version) for the different radiation analysis.

Its been more than 6 years, since I touched any antenna / Microwave related topics, hence I will not be providing and code support anymore. 
Hope these resources will help in your reflectarray project and do star my repo if it helps :)
