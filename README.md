# Reflectarray Designer Software

1. Install the software" ReflectArrayDesigner_Installer.exe
2. The element library* consists of the patch, double layer and patch ring elements all designed by me
3. The feed library consists of the different horn antennas for use in your reflectarray design, which is also designed by me

Do not click on the "Element Library" button, because I have removed the library from my google drive already.

Please do not distribute the software without my permission, Thank you :)

P.S.
*I have only published the 28GHz elements and no longer working on this project or any reflectarray related research*
