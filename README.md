# Reflectarray Designer Software

1. Install the software" ReflectArrayDesigner_Installer.exe
2. The element library* consists of the patch, double layer and patch ring elements all designed by me
3. The feed library consists of the different horn antennas for use in your reflectarray design, which is also designed by me

*I have only published the 28GHz elements

Please do not distribute the software without my permission, Thank you :)

P.S.
*I am no longer working on this project or any reflectarray related research*
