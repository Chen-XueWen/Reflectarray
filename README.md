# Reflectarray Designer Software

1. Install the software" ReflectArrayDesigner_Installer.exe
2. The element library* consists of the patch, double layer and patch ring elements
3. The feed library consists of the different horn antennas for use in your reflectarray design
4. The libraries are all designed by me, please only use it for your own research purpose

```
Do not click on the "Element Library" button, because I have removed the library from my google drive already, hence I have provided you the option to download from this github
```

### Reflectarray Designer Guide:
1. Click on the "Element Phase Path" button, and choose the "SquarePatch.csv" file from the element library
2. Next press the design button
3. After design is complete, the reflectarray characteristics will light up as shown below, this will allow you to understand your design better

3.1 When you click on the Radiation Pattern Prediction (based on array theory) it will output:

4. Click on the "Generate" button to generate the DXF file, toggle to MCR if you want MCR file.
5. Note that please press generate on the correct tab based on the files you are putting in, Square Patch csv & Square Patch tab, Layer csv to Layer tab
6. A new folder OneStopRA will be generated, containing the scripts
7. Aperture Efficiency Calculator provides user a convenient place the reflectarray efficiency after they have done the simulation in CST
8. Thats all



Please do not distribute the software without my permission, Thank you :)

P.S.
*I have only published the 28GHz elements and no longer working on this project or any reflectarray related research*
