# Reflectarray Designer Software

1. Install the software" ReflectArrayDesigner_Installer.exe
2. The element library* consists of the patch, double layer and patch ring elements
3. The feed library consists of the different horn antennas for use in your reflectarray design
4. The libraries are all designed by me, please only use it for your own research purpose

```
Do not click on the "Element Library" button, because I have removed the library from my google drive already, hence I have provided you the option to download from this github
```

Please do not distribute the software without my permission, Thank you :)

P.S.
*I have only published the 28GHz elements and no longer working on this project or any reflectarray related research*
